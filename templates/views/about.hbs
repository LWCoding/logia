                <p class="description">Centered in Chicago, Illinois, Fathima Shaikh is an avid runner,
                    writer, and science lover. Ever since she was a young girl, she has been fascinated 
                    by the complex system of the human body. Neurology and the science of the brain was 
                    something that intrigued her. Now that she is in high school, however, she has become 
                    captivated by the science of cancer and has begun learning about the biology of it. 
                    Wherever Fathima is not reading something up about science, you can often find her on 
                    her phone, running, or writing poems. She is excited to watch and assist in the growth 
                    of Logia and hopes to become an oncologist in the future.</p>

                <p class="description">During his middle school years, Lucas already knew he wanted to pursue a 
                    career in Computer Science, but realized that he had never actually placed much effort to 
                    working towards this goal. He is fascinated with creating visual representations and software 
                    with the use of technology. Being around people with similar interests, he always puts his 
                    best foot forward to extensively learn the basics of multiple programming languages, such as 
                    Python and C++. Competitiveness helped him grow in order to find a way to continue working 
                    towards his goals.</p>
